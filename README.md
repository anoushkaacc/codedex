## Predict Home Prices with Python and Linear Regression
Created a linear regression model to predict house prices based on house sizes. Using a scatterplot of test data, the model will form a relationship between the two variables and then make [predictions](https://github.com/anoushkaacc/codedex/tree/main/Predict%20home%20proces%20with%20python%20and%20linear%20regression) .
Libraries used: scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib .
